## 1.3.3 - 2020-12-10

### Changed

## 1.3.1 - 2020-12-07

### Fixed

- Ensure `isGraphiqlRequest` detects GraphiQL requests properly ([#23](https://github.com/jamesedmonston/graphql-authentication/issues/23) via [@approached](https://github.com/approached))

## 1.3.0 - 2020-12-06

## 1.2.2 - 2020-12-01

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with `Auth` GQL type not registering properly in production mode

## 1.2.0 - 2020-11-26

### Added

- Added ability to disable user registration

- Added Google Sign-In support (adds a single `googleSignIn` mutation, or mutations per user group, depending on settings)
- Added `SameSite` cookie policy control
- Added unique, per user caching, to ensure users never see each other's cached queries
- Added a `schema` field to the authentication mutation responses

### Changed

- Reworked the plugins settings into a tabbed interface
- The `register` mutation now listens to the `requireEmailVerification` setting in user settings – creating users in a pending state, and sending an activation email
- Tokens are now created using `microtime()` instead of `time()` to avoid any name conflicts

### Fixed

- Fixed some deprecation errors

### Misc

- Lots of under-the-hood tidying to make maintenance a lot easier

## 1.1.8 - 2020-11-14

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with saving token expiry as 'never'

## 1.1.7 - 2020-11-13

## 1.1.3 - 2020-11-09

## 1.1.2 - 2020-11-09

### Fixed

- Added empty fallback to `Craft::$app->getRequest()->getReferrer()`, to fix error if referrer is blank

## 1.1.1 - 2020-11-09

### Fixed

- Fixed issue with `isGraphiqlRequest` always returning `true`, breaking Craft's GraphiQL explorer

## 1.1.0 - 2020-11-04

### Added

- Added support for HTTP-Only cookie tokens, improving security (thanks [@timkelty](https://github.com/timkelty))
